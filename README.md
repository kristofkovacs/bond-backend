# Bond API Installation guide.
API to serve the clients of our badass new product. 

## Requirements
Every request must contain the header `Content-Type` : `application/json`.

## Installation
 Install node.js, install npm, [see here how to do it.](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-windows)
 Clone the project from github. 
 Install the dependencies from `package.json` using **npm**.
 Start the server by running **node `app.js`** .
 If the server is **up**, and **running**, [click here](http://localhost:3000) to see the `fancy API Doc`.
 If you encounter any **abnormalities**, **funny `javascript` errors**, or just want to have a talk, contact me on Slack.
